# About project

This is a movie library website. You can discover movies that are the most
popular for this day or week. You can find a particular movie that you are
interested in. You can also find some details about movies, watch a trailer, and
save them in 2 types of lists. First one - a list of movies that you are going
to watch (queue). Second - a list of movies that you were wathed (watched).
